Performance Log by Rohan Kanhaising Copyright 2020.

Performane Log is a opensource web application that will monitor your system information. This application is free to use.
Its still under construction; some features might not work and you might experience some bugs. I try to add as much as I can to this project.

NOTE: This project requires the latest NodeJS version!!

-----------------------------------


## How does it work?

Performance Log is a application that runs on NodeJS, so make sure you have NodeJS installed. You also need Visual Studio to open this solution.

When you launch open the batch file, run.bat, it will open a NodeJS server and it will start the webpage for you. You will 
be directed to the performance page (basically the index page). 

On that page (performance page), you will see 3 cards displaying information and usage about three hardware units; CPU, RAM and your Disk.
You can't do really much on that page except reading information and the usage.

The second working page is the energy page. On that page you will see information about your battery (if you have a laptop of course). It will show
your battery usage in a epic self-made CSS battery with cool waves in the background. 

The third page is the settings page. There are not much settings but there is some which is kind of useful. These settings are developerMode and darkTheme.
You might already know what these settings does. Its easy to change by pressing the toggle button. Or you can go to the settings file (settings.json) and change 
properties by yourself. Keep in mind that you have errors in the document (settings.json) or else the application won't work.

## New in version 0.5.1:

	- Rewrote some code.
	- Added a lot of notes into some js documents, to let the user see what the code does.
	- Added a lot of new features in the new commandline page.
	- This app is just amazing by itself.


## Ideas in mind that might come into the project (I am working on this):
	- Ability to launch games from the page.
	- Ability to control and host a dedicated Minecraft Server.
	- Ability to control and host a dedicated Web server.
	- Fixing bugs (that will always be a feauture).
