#Performance Log by Rohan Kanhaisingh

Performance Log by Rohan Kanhaising Copyright 2020.

Performane Log is a opensource web application that will monitor your system information. This application is free to use.
Its still under construction; some features might not work and you might experience some bugs. I try to add as much as I can to this project.

NOTE: This project requires the latest NodeJS version!!

-----------------------------------


#How does it work?

When you launch open the batch file, run.bat, it will open a NodeJS server and it will start the webpage for you. You will 
be directed to the performance page (basically the index page). 

On that page (performance page), you will see 3 cards displaying information and usage about three hardware units; CPU, RAM and your Disk.
You can't do really much on that page except reading information and the usage.

The second working page is the energy page. On that page you will see information about your battery (if you have a laptop of course). It will show
your battery usage in a epic self-made CSS battery with cool waves in the background. 

The third page is the settings page. There are not much settings but there is some which is kind of useful. These settings are developerMode and darkTheme.
You might already know what these settings does. Its easy to change by pressing the toggle button. Or you can go to the settings file (settings.json) and change 
properties by yourself. Keep in mind that you have errors in the document (settings.json) or else the application won't work.

#New in version 0.3:

	- Added 2 new pages; Energy usage and settings.
	- Fixed some server stuff.
	- Changed the background video again for dark theme users.


#Ideas in mind that might come into the project:
	- Ability to launch games from the page.
	- Ability to control the dekstop from the page (command line).
	- Fixing bugs (that will always be a feauture).
	- A card for the GPU unit (need alot of time working on this).
