# Performance Log

Performance Log, a NodeJS application.

Performane Log is a opensource web application that will monitor your system information. This application is free to use.
Its still under construction; some features might not work and you might experience some bugs. I try to add as much as I can to this project.

NOTE: This project requires the latest NodeJS version!!

-----------------------------------


## How does it work?

Performance Log is a application that runs on NodeJS, so make sure you have NodeJS installed. You also need Visual Studio to open this solution.

### Index page
When you launch open the batch file, run.bat, it will open a NodeJS server and it will start the webpage for you. You will 
be directed to the performance page (basically the index page). 

On that page (performance page), you will see 3 cards displaying information and usage about three hardware units; CPU, RAM and your Disk.
You can't do really much on that page except reading information and the usage.

### Energy page
The second working page is the energy page. On that page you will see information about your battery (if you have a laptop of course). It will show
your battery usage in a epic self-made CSS battery with cool waves in the background. 

### Commandline Page
This is my most favorite part of this project. This allows you to do a lot with this app and also your local machine. I made my own Performance Log commands but you are also able to use Powershell and CMD commands. This commandline has features to read files, start a minecraft server (not yet), control your desktop and many more.

### Settings page
The fourth page is the settings page. There are not much settings but there are some which are kind of useful. These settings are developerMode and darkTheme.
You might already know what these settings does. Its easy to change by pressing the toggle button. Or you can go to the settings file (settings.json) and change 
properties by yourself. Keep in mind that you have errors in the document (settings.json) or else the application won't work.


----------------------------------


## New in version 0.5.1:

	- Rewrote some code.
	- Added a lot of notes into some js documents, to let the user see what the code does.
	- Added a lot of new features in the new commandline page.
	- This app is just amazing by itself.


## Ideas in mind that might come into the project (I am working on this):
	- Ability to launch games from the page.
	- Ability to control and host a dedicated Minecraft Server.
	- Ability to control and host a dedicated Web server.
	- Fixing bugs (that will always be a feauture).

NOTE: Please not copy or share any of these file without the permission of the owner (Rohan Kanhaising). I spent a lot of time and energy into this project and I really like working on it. Wait... This makes no sense... This application is open-source, why would you not be able to copy and share any of these files. I actually have no idea lol

I hope you guys like this project :).
